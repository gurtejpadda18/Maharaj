        <p><em><strong><a href="https://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Paonta_sahib">Founder of Khalsa</a></strong></em> </p>
        <p>A divine messenger, a warrior, a poet, and a philosopher, <strong>Guru Gobind Singh Ji</strong> molded the Sikh religion into its present shape, with the institution of the Khalsa fraternity, and the completion of the sacred scripture, the
          <strong>Guru Granth Sahib Ji</strong>, in the final form that we find today. Before leaving his mortal body in 1708, Guru Gobind Singh decreed the Guru Granth Sahib Ji as the next and perpetual Guru of the Sikhs.

          It may not be out of context to consider that throughout the chronicles of human history, there has been no individual who lived a life more inspirational than Guru Gobind Singh Ji. He is variously revered as Sarbans Dani (the merciful
          donor, who
          sacrificed his all), Mard Agamra (man without any parallels), Shah-e-Shahenshah (emperor of emperors), Bar do Alam Shah (ruler of both worlds), amongst others.</p>
